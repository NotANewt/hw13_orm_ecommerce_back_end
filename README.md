## Credits

For this project, we were given starter code and instructed to build the back end. The back end coding was done by our instructor, Scott Brunswig. He walked through coding the homework over a series of office hours and, when it was complete, we all cloned the repository. I then created a new repository, copied the folders/files over, created my own env file, modified the connection.js file, and updated the README.
